# eg2_to_EIC

This code shows how to analyze the output of the GiBUU event generator (https://gibuu.hepforge.org/), which produces a ROOT output. 
This basically adds other kinematic variables that were not present in the standard GiBUU format.
It also shows some basic data manipulation using python dataframes and matplotlib.
The configuration files used to GiBUU to produce EIC simulations are attached as well.
